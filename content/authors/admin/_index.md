I've worked for Clinical Research Organizations (CROs) and Pharmaceutical companies as a Statistical Programmer and/or Statistician over the past 16 years. 

I've also co-authored publications and contributed to the acquisition and analysis of data presented in various manuscripts. I've experience in using statistical tools and methodologies and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs). I’ve a broad understanding of statistical concepts, methods and models and using computer applications such as R/Shiny, SAS, QLIK and TIBCO SPOTFIRE. I’m able to develop R packages/applications to communicate complex ideas.
